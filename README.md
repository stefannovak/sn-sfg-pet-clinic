# sn-sfg-pet-clinic
Following the classic Pet Clinic example to extend my Spring skills. Based off John Thompson's Spring course.
Starting the project by opening a GitHub repo as I want to be using Git more often while programming in IntelliJ.

--------
I split my project into a multi-module project, with modules for Spring Data and Spring Web. I created my standard model entities and began work on the interfaces for my service layer. I added a Maven Release plugin, and uploaded my repo to GitHub.

--------
Did some refactoring on my interfaces, implemented some maps with those interfaces. Created my starting index pages for vets and owners with their respective controllers. Spent most of the day brushing up on Java beans. I'm going to steer far from XML Bean configuration, and use Java beans in a config file whenever I need them.

As of the 3rd of July, I've implemented a ton of static resources, added master layouts, create entities and map services. I've begun to implement Hibernate into the project, using JPA and will soon begin writing tests.
